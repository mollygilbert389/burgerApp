## Description
This app was created using SQL, JavaScript, CSS, Handlebars, and uses an ORM database structure. In this app you can add a burger to the database then click the devour button to change the status of the burger to devoured. You can then reset all the burgers in the database to be devoured again. 
## Installation
SQL, Express
You will need MAMP and MySQL to run the database. With those you can pull down the code, run the servers and get this app running on your local host (8080). You will need to change the name of the database on your version as the keys needed to get this working are hidden in a .env file. 
## Usage
1. Run npm i 
2. Fire up the seed data in MySQL Workbench
3. Run npm start
## Dependencies
* dotenv
* express
* express-handlebars
* mysql
* handlebars
## Deployment
This is deployed on heroku. I used the free JawsDB plug-in for the database deployment. Check out the app here: https://mollywoodburgerapp.herokuapp.com/
